ZPM3 RELEASE - 24 Feb 2015
==========================

This is a re-release of the ZPM3FIX.ARC from volume 88 with one additional
feature.  Tilmann Reh has graciously given me permission to distribute the
ZPM3 source code which he produced over 20 years ago during a four month
disassembly exercise.

This archive also contains my disassembly of Simeon Cran's ZPM3LDR which 
supposedly fixes an issue with the standard CPM3LDR program.  I have not
spent much time with it but I have checked that what pops out of
	z80asm zpm3ldr
when linked with a loader BIOS generates a loader which is bit-for-bit
identical to that which is produced by linking Simeon's ZPM3LDR.REL to the
same loader BIOS.
