   This file contains a fully commented disassembly of the Digital Research
ASM assembler. I've provided it in two forms:

1) asm.asm -> using Intel 8080 ops. It can be assembled with the MAC or ASM
              assemblers.

2) asm.z80 -> using Zilog Z80 ops. It can be assembled with the Z80MR or
              compatible assembler.

I would welcome your comments or suggestions.
